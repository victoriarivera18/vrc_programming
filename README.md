I created a youtube channel in April 2020. It is a coding channel where I explain code for my homework and lab assignments in my CS courses. 
The motto of this channel is "If I can do it, so can you." 
I rarely see videos or websites that talk about the daily struggles of writing and debugging code or learning new coding principles. 
I film myself making mistakes and learning along and I hope other people are able to relate.
